# file_extenstion_utility_tools
A collection of utility functions to manipulate file extensions.

<br>
A few days ago, I had a project that generated thousands of images. It took around 4 hours to generate all of them. I then realized I forgot to add the ".png" extension when saving the images. So now I had thousands of images that were saved without extensions. Since there was no tool that automatically changed all file extensions in a folder, I decided to create that tool myself. 

When you have over 10,000 images that don't have extensions, and no tool to automate the process, the best way is to just automate it yourself.

While I was at it, I added some other image utility functions. Perhaps a better name for this repo should be "Emre's collection of random utilities". However, all utilities are still under the umbrella of the "images" category. So no need for a name change ... yet.
